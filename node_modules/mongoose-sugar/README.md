# mongoose-sugar - Sugary bits for Mongoose

mongoose-sugar adds some sugar on top of Mongoose and makes it a bit more
straightforward to use. In addition it adds some meta sugar to make it easier
to introspect the schema "as is".

Note that this is still in a very early stage of development so it's likely
it's missing some features you might need. If so, let me know and I'll look
into it.
