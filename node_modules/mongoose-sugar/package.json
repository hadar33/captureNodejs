In addition it adds some meta sugar to make it easier\nto introspect the schema \"as is\".\n\nNote that this is still in a very early stage of development so it's likely\nit's missing some features you might need. If so, let me know and I'll look\ninto it.\n\n## License\n\nmongoose-sugar is available under MIT. See LICENSE for more details.\n\n",
